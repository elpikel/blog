# How to squash last commits

Reset the current branch to the commit just before the last 2:

```
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command.
This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just
after a merge from that commit:

```
git merge --squash HEAD@{1}
```

Commit those squashed changes.  The commit message will be helpfully
prepopulated with the commit messages of all the squashed commits:

```
git commit -m "new commit message"
```
